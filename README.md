# this mod is deprecated, go to [the original mod](https://github.com/andrewlalis/SpeedCarts), [High-Speed Rail](https://modrinth.com/mod/highspeed-rail), or [Tatercart](https://modrinth.com/mod/tatercart) for similar features.

# Speed Carts Rerailed

This mod adds the ability to control minecarts with signs, but in many more ways than the original.
All you need to do is place a sign beside the rail, and put either a number, color, or name on the first line of the sign that indicates the desired speed of the train in meters per second, the line of the train, and the next station respectively.

## Credits

The [Original Mod](https://github.com/andrewlalis/SpeedCarts) that this was forked off of, thanks Andrew!

[Main Inspiration](https://github.com/PrincessCyanMarine/FasterMinecarts), the speedometer system in SCR is a heavily modified version of Faster Minecarts.

And also [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create), for their train system being unique and close to real life, I thought I should mention them.

### Main Plans
- [ ] Line Distinction via Signs with colors on them
- [ ] Make Stations less demanding, slow, and buggy, also add the ability to name them
- [ ] Functional Speedometer with IRL equivalents
- [ ] Fix the bugginess of riding at high speeds
- [ ] Add misc and QOL changes 
  - [ ] If a train is named "slow" it will not react to signs
  - [ ] Config if Powered Rails are always on, or to expand the length of the redstone power
  - [ ] Speedometer options are by each player, and controlled client-side if they have the mod installed
- [ ] Fix translations not displaying correctly, add Vietnamese, and correct French
- [ ] Finish the "How To Use" section of the README
