## FAQ

Q: Forge or Bukkit?

A: stop asking in curseforge comment sections or else you forfeit your spleen. maybe, *maybe* paper/bukkit support, but im not familiar with Forge or paper, so unless someone wants to take the initiative to make a forge fork, it won't exist.


Q: Found a bug?

A: GitHub issues please.

## Credits

The [Original Mod](https://github.com/andrewlalis/SpeedCarts) that this was forked off of, thanks Andrew!

[Main Inspiration](https://github.com/PrincessCyanMarine/FasterMinecarts), the speedometer system in SCR is a heavily modified version of Faster Minecarts.

And also [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create), for their train system being unique and close to real life, I thought I should mention them.
