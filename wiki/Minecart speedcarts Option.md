# The `speedcarts` Option

The speedcarts option is the original part of the mod, the part that started it all. 
Anyway, here is how it works.

This option is all about signs and specifically the top line

Here is an example sign

In case you want a specific IRL speed:

| MPS     | KPH       | MPH        | Notes                                                                                              |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 8 MPS   | 28.8 KPH  | 17.89 MPH  | The vanilla speed, too slow imo. The speed limit in some parking lots.                             |
| 30 MPS  | 108 KPH   | 67.11 MPH  | Near highway speeds, anything above is unnecessary                                                 |
| 84 MPS  | 302.4 KPH | 187.90 MPH | Literally the speed of a bullet train, completely unnecessary                                      |
| 128 MPS | 460.8 KPH | 286.33 MPH | Maximum speed for the default Config of this mod, 100% will derail on turns. Be careful with this. |
